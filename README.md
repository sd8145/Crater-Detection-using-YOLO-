This project focuses on detecting craters on planetary surfaces using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm, enhanced with visualizations from Weights & Biases (W&B). By leveraging YOLO's real-time detection capabilities and W&B's robust experiment tracking and visualization tools, this project aims to provide an efficient and visually insightful approach to crater detection. The integration with W&B not only facilitates detailed tracking of model performance and metrics but also enables collaborative analysis and sharing of results. This setup ensures a streamlined workflow for training, evaluating, and refining the crater detection model, making it an invaluable tool for researchers and enthusiasts in the field of planetary science.
